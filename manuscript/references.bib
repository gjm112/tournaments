               according to their true latent strength is analysed. To this
               end, a new approach for estimating attacking and defensive
               strengths based on the Poisson regression for modelling match
               outcomes is proposed. Various performance metrics are estimated
               reflecting the agreement between latent teams' strength
               parameters and their final rank in the league table. The
               tournament designs studied here are used in the majority of
               European top-tier association football competitions. Based on
               numerical experiments, it turns out that a two-stage league
               format comprising of the three round-robin tournament together
               with an extra single round-robin is the most efficacious
               setting. In particular, it is the most accurate in selecting the
               best team as the winner of the league. Its efficacy can be
               enhanced by setting the number of points allocated for a win to
               two (instead of three that is currently in effect in association
               football).",

               Journal of Political Economy, 64, 242--258) foundational sports
               economics hypotheses is that fans prefer their team to win but
               with more match outcome uncertainty (MOU) rather than less. The
               testable implication is that increase in home team win chances
               and match `tightness' should lead to increased fan demand for
               live attendance. It is safe to say that the verdict by those
               that voice one, especially recently, is that empirical results
               offer only occasional and weak support for Rottenberg's
               hypothesis. We show that a more agnostic examination of the
               literature suggests that there is much more evidence failing to
               reject Rottenberg's hypothesis than previously acknowledged. We
               also show that Rottenberg's hypothesis is only one alternative
               generated by the standard economics of sports leagues. Rejecting
               Rottenberg's hypothesis does not necessarily reject the
               importance of MOU with a different predicted sign as a demand
               determinant. This suggests additional testing tasks for the body
               of work that has moved on to loss aversion based on the prospect
