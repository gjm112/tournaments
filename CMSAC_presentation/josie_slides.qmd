::: notes
-   4 team single elimination tournament:
    -   Dream Team vs Work Group vs Middle School Girls Team vs Babies
-   If we only care about the top team winning, seeding structure does not matter
-   If we care about who gets second and third, seeding becomes important
    -   Would not pair up Work Group and Dream Team in the first round

## Comparing Structures

-   Which competition structure is best at reflecting the true strengths of competitors?

-   **Efficacy**[^1]: Final rankings should match the true rankings of the strength of the competitors

-   **Effectivity**[^2]: Interested in correctly ranking the best competitor as first

## Efficacy and Effectivity

-   Decide how many rankings are important
    -   Olympic competition ranks the top 3 competitors
    -   Premier League: top 4 (Champions League) and bottom 3 (Relegation)
-   **Salient ranks**: the ranks that matter
    -   Efficacy: 1 through $n$ matter
    -   Effectivity: 1 is only salient rank

## Goal

-   Want to quantify how well a structure can accurately order the competitors
-   We will propose a metric that quantifies how effectively different tournament structures convey information about competitors’ true strengths

## Distribution of $\hat{r}$

```{r}
ranks <- seq(1:3)
permn(ranks) %>% unlist() %>% matrix(ncol = 3, byrow = TRUE)

```
