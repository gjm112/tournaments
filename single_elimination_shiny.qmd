### Things To Do

-   Add a re-seeded option

-   Custom strengths (likely as an input to the function)

# Simulate a Single Match

```{r}
# Function to simulate a match using Bradley-Terry model
simulate_match <- function(team1, team2, strength1, strength2) {
  if (is.na(team1)) {
    return(team2)
  } else if (is.na(team2)) {
    return(team1)
  } else {
    p <- exp(strength1 - strength2) / (1 + exp(strength1 - strength2))
    return(ifelse(runif(1) < p, team1, team2))  # Randomize outcome
  }
}

```

# Single Elimination Tournament Structures

## Creating the traditional tournament structure for n teams

```{r}
generate_elimination_tournament_structure <- function(n) {

  is_power_of_two <- function(x) {
    x > 0 && (x & (x - 1)) == 0
  }
  
  # If n is not a power of 2, round up to the next power of 2 and add placeholders
  if (!is_power_of_two(n)) {
    next_power_of_two <- 2^ceiling(log2(n))
    extra_teams <- next_power_of_two - n
    #message(sprintf("Rounding up to %d teams. Adding %d NA placeholders.", next_power_of_two, extra_teams))
    n <- next_power_of_two
  } else {
    extra_teams <- 0
  }

    if (teams[i] > teams[i + 1]) {
      c(teams[i + 1], teams[i])  # Swap if needed
    } else {
      c(teams[i], teams[i + 1])
    }
  })
  )
  
  while (extra_teams > 0){
      teams[which.max(teams)] <- NA
      extra_teams <- extra_teams - 1
  }
  
  return(teams)
}

nextLayer <- function(teams) {
  out <- c()  # Initialize an empty vector
  length <- length(teams) * 2 + 1  # Calculate the length for pairing
  
  # Generate the next layer by pairing teams
  for (i in teams) {
    out <- c(out, i, length - i)  # Push the current team and its pair
  }
  
  return(out)
}
